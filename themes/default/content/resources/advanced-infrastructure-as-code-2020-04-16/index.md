  title: Advanced Infrastructure as Code
  description: "This workshop will cover advanced [infrastructure as
    code](/what-is/what-is-infrastructure-as-code/) topics including using and
    authoring components, multi-stack architectures and testing - as well as how
    to apply infrastructure as code to Kubernetes - both for provisioning
    managed Kubernetes clusters and deploying Kubernetes applications and
    services on top of existing clusters.


    After completing this workshop, you’ll be up and running with IaC
    fundamentals, modern application architectures across many clouds, and
    Kubernetes best-practices that are ready for production environments.
    You’ll also be ready to empower your development teams to be more
    productive - continuously deploying both their applications and
    infrastructure.
